# HealthCare Management System
Effective healthcare management using SQL.

This project showcases the use of SQL to enhance patient care quality and operational efficiency in healthcare management. By leveraging data-driven insights, these queries aim to optimize resource allocation, track patient outcomes, and improve decision-making processes. 


Using MySQL Workbench, we were able to efficiently manage the database, run complex queries, and visualize results to derive meaningful insights for healthcare management.
Below is a list of SQL queries implemented in this project, designed to address various aspects of healthcare management:

1. Find all appointments scheduled on a specific date (e.g., '2023-07-16').
2. List all procedures performed during a specific appointment.
3. Retrieve the specialization in Dermatology from the doctors table.
4. Find all billing records for a specific doctor (e.g., DoctorID = 262) by joining with the Appointments table.
5. List all appointments along with the names of the patients and doctors.
6. Retrieve the names and contact details of doctors who have performed procedures.
7. Calculate the total amount billed to each patient.
8. List all doctors along with the number of appointments they have scheduled.
9. Generate a detailed report of all appointments, including patient details, doctor details, and any associated procedures.
10. Find the doctor with the highest total amount billed for their patients.
11. Identify patients who have had appointments with more than four different doctors.
12. Calculate the average amount billed per appointment for each doctor.
13. Find all patients who have had at least one billing transaction above a specific amount (e.g., 900000).


These queries are designed to provide insights and support better decision-making in healthcare management.
